How to check GAN's generator ability? 

I think, we can check our generator model by using t-SNE!

First, split MNIST file

Second, train GAN model for each class

Third, train CNN model for MNIST

Fourth, check generated image with real image using t-sne

Fifth, check CNN feature map of generated image and real image using t-sne
